                **Press Release** <br>
                **For Immediate Release** <br>
                Date: November 06, 2025 <br>
                Time: 6:00PM Mountain <br>
                From: FIA Stewards <br>
                To: All Competitors, All Teams <br>

                **SUBJECT:** Decision – Baku Incidents: Eddie & Leo, Travis & Eddie, Erick & Boz, and Josh <br>

                **DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENTS** <br>
                Eddie (Alpine) was stalled on the racing line in Sector 3 during a VSC around a blind corner, where Leo (Ferrari) ran into the back of Eddie.

                Travis (McLaren) lost control of his vehicle after hitting a wall in the middle of Sector 2, and collided with Eddie (Alpine).

                Erick (Ferrari) was given an in race 10 second penalty while two cars covered the entire width of the track due to a collision with Boz (Aston Martin).

                Josh (VCARB) was given an in race 10 second penalty while navigating between two sideways cars on track.

                **FINDINGS & DECISION: Eddie & Leo** <br>
                Upon reviewing footage and the nature of the blind turn, the FIA Stewards have determined that Eddie could have made evasive maneuvers to get off of the racing line in a blind corner. Due to this, Eddie caused the incident with a nearly defenseless Leo. Per league regulations, Eddie will have a 5 place penalty added to his finishing place and a penalty point added to his super license. Due to other circumstances, Eddie did not finish the race, and therefore his final standing will still be classified as DNF regardless of the penalty.

                **FINDINGS & DECISION: Travis & Eddie** <br>
                After reviewing all mitigating circumstances and potential outcomes, the FIA Stewards have come to a final verdict that Travis is at fault for the collision with Eddie. Travis had opportunities to safely come out of AI control or retire the car that could have eliminated this outcome. Therefore, because Eddie's race was ended, Travis will be penalized for 5 places to his finishing position as well as have a penalty point added to his super license. Due to this incident, Travis did not finish the race, and therefore his final standing will still be classified as DNF regardless of the penalty.
                
                **FINDINGS & DECISION: Erick & Boz** <br>
                When reviewing the data, it is clear that the 10 second penalty provided to Erick during the race was unfairly awarded. Therefore, he will have 10 seconds removed from his finishing time, pushing him up the standings 1 position into 6th.

                **FINDINGS & DECISION: Josh** <br>
                While reviewing onboard footage, it is clear that Josh did not contact any of the vehicles in the accident. Therefore, Josh will be granted his 10 seconds back on his finishing time which results in his final place being 5th.

                **FURTHER NOTES** <br>
                The FIA Stewards remind all competitors that situational awareness and car control remain the driver’s responsibility at all times, this includes when a car is damaged. Communication is critical in scenarios like this. Additionally, league officials would like to remind all drivers that clean driving is critical to the competitiveness of the league. As the season continues, we wish each driver the best of luck and look forward to seeing how the season progresses.

                Alright, with all that vibe killing stuff out of the way, it's time to review the turbo mess that was Baku. Drivers crashing from Lap 1 all the way to the end. Even the top contenders sucked, damaging wings early and late.

                I have decided that due to this hot garbage dumpster fire race, it is time to revamp the format for this special occasion. No one will be safe in this new format. Each driver is going to be ripped into mercilessly with memes and mini-recaps of their race.

                To make this happen though, I had to make a deal with the boss. Before the memes begin, I will do a micro-recap of qualifying and the race. Enjoy the boring stuff, or skip it and go check out the memes (do that, no cap this next part blows).

                **QUALIFYING**  
                Pretty standard qualifying, honestly. No real shakeups. Well...except the catastrophe at the end of Q1. VCARB driver Josh started singing 'Jesus Take the Wheel,' and demolished his entire car after already making it into Q2.

                Bro must have tipped his mechanics big time becase they got the car back together for him ASAP and he started from last on the grid for the race.

                Mercedes' Jairo took home another pole position with Alpine's Joshua right behind. Honestly, I thought Joshua was fast, but he's getting obliterated this season in qualifying. Shmuck. Last year's champ and race winner also dropped a stinker and qualified in 5th.

                **RACE**  
                The race was dumb. Safety Cars left right and center. Even a Red Flag occurred. Which was boring just staring at nothing until the drivers got rolling again. But whatever.

                After the Red Flag drivers decided to be as dull as possible. Barely any overtakes, no real meaningful pitstop strategies, and truly nothing out of the ordinary.

                That was until Alpine's Joshua decided to stink it up again. But more on that below. The race finished with 1 & 2 how they started and somehow McLaren's Nick made up ground on these guys...oh, I am getting word that is because the drivers in front of him both hit walls, gotcha, nice job Patrick and Jaden.

                Ok, onto the good stuff. As always, enjoy.
