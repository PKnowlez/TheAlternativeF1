New York born, second youngest driver on the grid, and Alpine’s all star driver, Joshua is the key to Alpine’s bright future. 

A motorsport fan since he was born, Joshua fell in love with NASCAR and Super-cross, but recently has fallen for F1 and aspires to become a Formula 1 driver. He started racing go-karts at the age of 10 and later stopped due to knee injuries at 15. Now he feels like he is living the dream again with new found love for sim racing with many new faces. 

Joshua also grew up in the same building as his teammate Eddie. Long time friends and haters which is apparent in the way they talk to each other. However, they are like brothers and love each other a lot. Joshua and Eddie train together to become better and better each day to bring a constructor championship for Alpine, with Joshua’s expertise proving to be an incredible asset for Eddie’s growth.

His goal for future seasons is to win as many Driver’s and Constructor’s Championships as possible. Personally, he wants to bring home as many fastest laps as he can to prove he is the quickest on track. Joshua prides himself on his speed and plans to continue to be a dominant force within the league for years to come.
