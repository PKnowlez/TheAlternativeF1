                While the standings are useful, they do not tell the whole story of which teams are trending up throughout the season even without big wins or flashy moments.
                
                To kick off the season, the FIA and the race stewards have ranked each team. Initial rankings positioned teams where they finished last season. From there, the results of the preseason race and a few other factors shuffled the order a bit. Not much changed for our top three teams from last season, however Mercedes and Aston Martin both had strong performances, leading to minor shifts in the lower power rankings.

                Red Bull & Mercedes have decided to tango a bit in the mid-field. The teams have swapped back and forth yet again due to the performances from last night's race.

                Red Bull primarily benefitted from the FIA removing Brently's penalty and the league reinstating Matthew's finishing point.

                Additionally, with strong qualifying and from winning the race, the VCARB team promoted themselves up the rankings. However, this is likely more due to McLaren's lack of a second #1 driver during the race with Travis disqualified by the FIA.
                
                Alpine remains the top contender at this stage even though they are in second overall in the Constructor Standings.

                After an incredible performance during the sprint, Mercedes had a lack luster outing in the main race. This keeps them low in the power rankings.

                Red Bull and Ferrari made a swap due to the incredible performance by Brently who is solidifying himself as the team's number one early in the season.

                After the preseason and Bahrain, it seemed the VCARB team had things sorted out and were rocketing towards the top. However, there is a chance they were just a shooting star.

                Due to this, as well as having a full line up, McLaren overtakes into second place and nearly dislodges Alpine from their perch atop the rankings.

                With the first break of the season over, the drivers took Spain's high speed circuit, where tire wear, dirty air, and a whole lot of flare occurred.

                Mercedes took home its first full length race win of the season helping them move up in the power rankings. Alpine stays top dog though as McLaren falters and VCARB takes second place back.

                In the midfield, Aston Martin and Ferrari stocks plummet as the teams faced minor setbacks during the race, while Red Bull seemed to have started to get things figured out.

                All in all this was a turbulent race and the power rankings reflect that. In Mexico, expect to see more position swapping here as tire wear is again a major concern going into the race.

                There was nearly nothing to meme this week, so I decided to take the week off just like the Taveras. My boss told me I couldn't simply do nothing this week so I told him I would write something for this power ranking.

                But like, honestly, this is the most dry thing on the planet. Who actually cares? Whatever. Alpine sucks so they dropped down. Eddie not being around is a joke, and I keep hearing Joshua yell, "LOCK IN JUNIOR," but then it's just echos because Eddie ain't locking in.

                Mercedes is obviously on the rise, but the boss said something about how the math doesn't let them leap frog a bunch of positions. Math sucks. Anyway, enjoy the rankings, at least its colorful.
